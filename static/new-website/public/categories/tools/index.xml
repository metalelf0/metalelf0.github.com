Fluentd is an open source tool to collect events and logs. Its architecture allows to easily collect logs from different input sources and redirect them to different output sinks. Some input examples are HTTP, syslog, or apache logs, and some output sinks are files, mail, and databases (both RDBMS and NoSQL ones). Also, it allows to parse logs and to extract only the significative parts from each of them; saving this structured information on a DB allows much easier log searching and analysis.</description>

I have a lot of Vim colorschemes, and I like to change them very often, reflecting my mood. I needed a way to showcase them all and quickly pick one.
The original Vim Color Scheme Test script by maverick.woo is written in Perl and the build works on Windows systems. I wanted to add some new features, and to test it with my own colorschemes, but as I&amp;rsquo;m not very confident with Perl, I preferred to start over with a new Ruby version instead of forking his project.</description>

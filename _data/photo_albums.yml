# Photo Albums Configuration
#
# Define your photo albums here. Each album should have:
# - title: Display name for the album
# - slug: URL-friendly identifier (used in /photos/[slug]/)
# - position: Integer for sorting (lower numbers appear first in the listing)
# - images_path: Relative path from site root to the folder containing images
#                Can point to either photos/albums/ (local dev) or photos/resized/ (production)
#                The plugin will automatically detect which folder has images
# - date: (optional) Date string in YYYY-MM-DD format for display purposes
# - cover_image: (optional) Filename of the photo to use as album cover (e.g., "005.jpg")
#                If not specified, the first photo will be used

  <summary>Wow, it’s been quite a long time since my last post. I’m still a vim addict, but I moved to neovim in the recent years, and today I wanna share a quick trick that you might find useful.

I’m going to build a custom interactive menu with custom options. I’ll use it to access some files whose location I often forget, but you’ll see how easy it is to customize it to do anything you want. And the b...</summary>

  <summary>I like to change my (neo)vim colorscheme quite frequently, and when I do I want it to match my iterm colors. Many colorscheme authors also provide an iterm color palette, so you can import the .itermcolors file, create a new iterm profile with that palette, start a new session and you have the same vim colorscheme in your iterm. But then, when you launch vim, you still have to type :colorscheme...</summary>

  <summary>Yesterday I had to refactor a very large ruby class. It had a lot of methods and, to make it cleaner, I decided to sort methods alphabetically.

Is there a way to do this in vim? Of course there is, and it’s quite tricky - so let’s see how we can do it.

The basic idea is taken from this post on wincent.com, I just adapted it for ruby. All credits to this guy for his work :)

We’ll use the same...</summary>

  <summary>Minitest is good for mocking, right? Well…

Minitest is gaining a lot of popularity and can actually be a 100% replacement for RSpec. It’s a pure ruby testing framework, it’s fast, light weight, and it supports both a test-unit like syntax and a spec engine with Rspec like syntax.

Still, when it comes to mocking, it can be a little painful. You have to initialize mocks and verify them manually...</summary>

The domain is registered on Namecheap, and the integration was done following instructions on this gist. Last week, I received an email from Google saying that some users had been added as property owners of my Google Search Console property. This raised an eyebrow, and I checked my website.

Iâ€™m still a vim addict, but I moved to neovim in the recent years, and today I wanna share a quick trick that you might find useful. Iâ€™m going to build a custom interactive menu with custom options. Iâ€™ll use it to access some files whose location I often forget, but youâ€™ll see how easy it is to customize it to do anything you want. And the b...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Vim - Change Colorscheme Based on Iterm profile</title><link href="https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/change-vim-colorscheme-based-on-iterm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vim - Change Colorscheme Based on Iterm profile" /><published>2016-12-19T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2016-12-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/change-vim-colorscheme-based-on-iterm/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/change-vim-colorscheme-based-on-iterm/" /> <author> <name>Andrea Schiavini</name> </author> <category term="posts" /> <category term="technical" /> <summary>I like to change my (neo)vim colorscheme quite frequently, and when I do I want it to match my iterm colors. Many colorscheme authors also provide an iterm color palette, so you can import the .itermcolors file, create a new iterm profile with that palette, start a new session and you have the same vim colorscheme in your iterm. But then, when you launch vim, you still have to type :colorscheme...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Vim - sort ruby methods by name</title><link href="https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/vim-sort-ruby-methods-by-name/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vim - sort ruby methods by name" /><published>2016-07-29T02:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2016-07-29T02:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/vim-sort-ruby-methods-by-name/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/vim-sort-ruby-methods-by-name/" /> <author> <name>Andrea Schiavini</name> </author> <category term="posts" /> <category term="technical" /> <summary>Yesterday I had to refactor a very large ruby class. It had a lot of methods and, to make it cleaner, I decided to sort methods alphabetically. Is there a way to do this in vim? Of course there is, and itâ€™s quite tricky - so letâ€™s see how we can do it. The basic idea is taken from this post on wincent.com, I just adapted it for ruby. All credits to this guy for his work :) Weâ€™ll use the same...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Mocked - a minitest pattern</title><link href="https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/mocked-a-minitest-pattern/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mocked - a minitest pattern" /><published>2016-05-11T02:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2016-05-11T02:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/mocked-a-minitest-pattern/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://www.andreaschiavini.com/posts/mocked-a-minitest-pattern/" /> <author> <name>Andrea Schiavini</name> </author> <category term="posts" /> <category term="technical" /> <summary>Minitest is good for mocking, right? Wellâ€¦ Minitest is gaining a lot of popularity and can actually be a 100% replacement for RSpec. Itâ€™s a pure ruby testing framework, itâ€™s fast, light weight, and it supports both a test-unit like syntax and a spec engine with Rspec like syntax. Still, when it comes to mocking, it can be a little painful. You have to initialize mocks and verify them manually...</summary> </entry> </feed>

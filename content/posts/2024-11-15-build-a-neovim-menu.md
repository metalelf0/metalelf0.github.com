Wow, it's been quite a long time since my last post. I'm still a vim addict, but I moved to neovim in the recent years, and today I wanna share a quick trick that you might find useful.

I'm going to build a custom interactive menu with custom options. I'll use it to access some files whose location I often forget, but you'll see how easy it is to customize it to do anything you want. And the best part is, you don't need any external plugin to use it :)

Here's an example of how it's looking:

And here's the code, which I'll explain line by line:

```lua

local M = {}
local core = require("lib/core")

M.commands = {}

M.commands.EditNeovimConfig = {
	command = ":e " .. core.get_configdir() .. "/init.lua",
	description = "ÓöÆ Edit neovim config",
}

M.commands.EditBatConfig = { command = ":e ~/.config/bat/config", description = "ü¶á Edit bat config" }
M.commands.EditInbox = { command = ":e ~/iCloud-Obsidian/work/inbox.md", description = "üì• Inbox" }
M.commands.EditKittyConfig = { command = ":e ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf", description = "üê± Edit kitty config" }
M.commands.EditLazygitConfig =
	{ command = ":e ~/Library/Application Support/lazygit/config.yml", description = "üî± Edit lazygit config" }
M.commands.EditWeztermConfig =
	{ command = ":e ~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua", description = "üîß Edit Wezterm config" }
M.commands.EditGhosttyConfig = { command = ":e ~/.config/ghostty/config", description = "üëª Edit Ghostty config" }
M.commands.SourceCurrentLuaFile = { command = ":luafile %", description = "üèÑ Lua: source current file" }

M.run = function()
	vim.ui.select(vim.tbl_keys(M.commands), {
		prompt = "Whattya wanna do?",
		format_item = function(item)
			return M.commands[item].description
		end,
	}, function(choice)
		local chosen_command = M.commands[choice]
		vim.cmd(chosen_command.command)
	end)
end

return M
```

This is a classic Lua module. I saved it under `lua/user/quick-menu.lua` in my neovim config dir.

To show the available commands, get the user input and execute the chosen command, we're going to use the `vim.ui.select` function from neovim.

As you can see in the documentation (`:h vim.ui.select()`), here's what this function does:

```
vim.ui.select({items}, {opts}, {on_choice})                  *vim.ui.select()*
    Prompts the user to pick from a list of items, allowing arbitrary
    (potentially asynchronous) work until `on_choice`.
```

The documentation also gives us an example:

```lua
vim.ui.select({ 'tabs', 'spaces' }, {
    prompt = 'Select tabs or spaces:',
    format_item = function(item)
        return "I'd like to choose " .. item
    end,
}, function(choice)
    if choice == 'spaces' then
        vim.o.expandtab = true
    else
        vim.o.expandtab = false
    end
end)
```

So, we need:
- a set of options to be picked (in the example, `tabs` and `spaces`);
- a `format_item` function that takes an item as an input and returns a string description of the option;
- a function to be executed once `choice` has been picked.

If we have just a couple options, it's fine to inline them as in the example; but if we need something more complicated, like in our menu, a custom data structure will be handy. So, we're going to define a `M.commands` table, where each row will include the `command` to be executed when chosen, and the `description` to be displayed to the user.

Our module will also expose a `run` method that will be responsible of calling `vim.ui.select` and bind our table to make everything work.

Let's look at the `run` method again:

```lua
M.run = function()
	vim.ui.select(vim.tbl_keys(M.commands), {
		prompt = "Whattya wanna do?",
		format_item = function(item)
			return M.commands[item].description
		end,
	}, function(choice)
		local chosen_command = M.commands[choice]
		vim.cmd(chosen_command.command)
	end)
end
```

The list of available options to be displayed can be extracted from the `M.commands` table with `vim.tbl_keys`, an utility function that extracts keys from a lua table. This will return the list of keys in the `M.commands` table, so `EditNeovimConfig`, `EditKittyConfig` and so on.

The next step is to write the `format_item` function, that will take an item (e.g. `EditNeovimConfig`) and will need to return its description. It's pretty easy, as we just need to read the `M.commands[item]` row and get its `description`.

Finally, once the user has picked a command, we need to execute it. Every `command` in our `M.commands` is a vimscript command that can be executed with the `vim.cmd` shorthand, so reading it and executing is pretty straightforward.

Now that everything is in place, we just need to setup a key binding to trigger the menu. I have this under `<Leader>hL`, and here's how to do it:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>hL", function()
	require("user.quick-menu").run()
end, { desc = "Quick menu" })
```

Write this in any file, restart neovim and you will be ready to go!

I hope everything is clear, feel free to ask in the disqus comments below if you need any further info.

Thanks for your time!

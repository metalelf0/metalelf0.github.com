      <title>Vim - sort ruby methods by name</title>

      <description>
Yesterday I had to refactor a very large ruby class. It had a lot of methods and, to make it cleaner, I decided to sort methods alphabetically.
Is there a way to do this in vim? Of course there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite tricky - so let&amp;rsquo;s see how we can do it.
The basic idea is taken from this post on wincent.com, I just adapted it for ruby.</description>

      <title>Mocked - a minitest pattern</title>

      <description>
Minitest is good for mocking, right? Well&amp;hellip; Minitest is gaining a lot of popularity and can actually be a 100% replacement for RSpec. It&amp;rsquo;s a pure ruby testing framework, it&amp;rsquo;s fast, light weight, and it supports both a test-unit like syntax and a spec engine with Rspec like syntax.
Still, when it comes to mocking, it can be a little painful. You have to initialize mocks and verify them manually after running the code under test.</description>

      <title>Command pattern in ruby and rails</title>

      <description>
The problem If you have a growing Rails application and you feel your models are getting too fat you might have a problem. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been educated with the &amp;ldquo;fat models, thin controllers&amp;rdquo; dogma - but sometimes putting all the domain logic inside the models has its downsides.
As an example, the typical flow of an ActiveRecord object through a Rails request involves:
 fetching the object from the DB based on the params you receive (controller); doing something with the object inside the model (model); when something goes wrong, you set errors onto the model attributes (model); you finally return the object to the view, and present it accordingly (view).</description>

The problem Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a project I work on a lot of occurrences of this code:
if user.privacy &amp;amp;&amp;amp; user.privacy.enables_page?(...) The first part of the condition above is a bad practice in object oriented design. It forces collaborators of user to know a part of its implementation
 it could have a privacy or it couldn&amp;rsquo;t.  What we want Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be much better to just write this:</description>

      <title>Fluentd usage example with bash and ruby</title>

      <description>
Fluentd is an open source tool to collect events and logs. Its architecture allows to easily collect logs from different input sources and redirect them to different output sinks. Some input examples are HTTP, syslog, or apache logs, and some output sinks are files, mail, and databases (both RDBMS and NoSQL ones). Also, it allows to parse logs and to extract only the significative parts from each of them; saving this structured information on a DB allows much easier log searching and analysis.</description>

      <description>
Today after releasing an app to production environment I saw a couple of paperclip warnings like this in my production.log file:
[paperclip] Duplicate URL for round_image with /system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename. This will clash with attachment defined in PageElements::FranchisingCarouselEntry class  This happens because I defined an attachment with the same name in two different models, and the default strategy Paperclip uses to choose attachment locations could lead to filename clashing.</description>

      <title>Vim regexp example: make a variable out of params</title>

Today I wrote a regexp to change params[:page] into page. Here you are:
:&#39;&amp;lt;,&#39;&amp;gt;s/params\[:\(\p\{-}\)\]/\1/g  Let&amp;rsquo;s explain it briefly:
  the first part, :&#39;&amp;lt;,&#39;&amp;gt;s/, is the vim command to substitute a pattern (or a regexp) with another one. The &amp;lt;,&#39;&amp;gt; part tells vim to operate on the visually selected text.
  the second part is the trickiest one. Let&amp;rsquo;s see it part to part:</description>

      <description>
Ctags are a great way to improve navigation between large codebases. Used together with vim they allow to quickly jump to any method definition with just a keystroke - C-]. Adding your bundle dir when generating the tags file will allow jumping to the internals of the ruby gems you are using. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to do this.
The setup needed is the following:

      <title>Howto share Spree authentication/authorization engine</title>

In a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on I&amp;rsquo;m using spree as a mountable engine. The host application has its own administration area, and I wanted to share the spree authentication with my app.
Spree uses devise to handle authentication. The code which is responsible for the authentication part of the app is in the auth module of Spree.
To share authentication with your application you have to:</description>

      <description>
I have a lot of Vim colorschemes, and I like to change them very often, reflecting my mood. I needed a way to showcase them all and quickly pick one.
The original Vim Color Scheme Test script by maverick.woo is written in Perl and the build works on Windows systems. I wanted to add some new features, and to test it with my own colorschemes, but as I&amp;rsquo;m not very confident with Perl, I preferred to start over with a new Ruby version instead of forking his project.</description>

      <description>
In a Rails application I am working on, I needed to setup a form with a field with a non-standard behaviour. The field represents a Date object, so the date_select FormHelper looked great; however, the date to display was not the actual date to be set on the database, but the day before. Changing all the data on the DB was a bit risky, so I had to stick with this requirement.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;d bet a lot of ruby devs actually found themselves stuck in this problem. You checkout a github repo, you run a bundle install and = duh = a gem cannot install because of a missing library. You&amp;rsquo;re sure you&amp;rsquo;ve already installed the library or dependency or whatever, but in a different path from the standard one (in this example I&amp;rsquo;m talking about PostgreSQL installed via the graphical installer instead of the ubuntu apt repo); so you issue the command</description>

      <description>
It may happen that you need to display the results of a MySQL query on a page. E.g., your customer asks you to add a report on a page, and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to build a custom template, but just write the query and see the results.
We can do this easily thanks to the terminal-table gem (see http://github.com/visionmedia/terminal-table). This gem allows printing an ASCII table, just like the one you see when you use MySQL from the terminal.</description>

      <description>
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore a couple of solutions to dynamically add a split_by_half behaviour to an array object. The first technique is the mixin: it allows to add the method to a single array instance. The second one is called monkey patching, and adds the method directly to the Array class, adding this behaviour to every array instance.</description>
